Python code for Quiz game

Task Description: Advanced Quiz Application
Overview
You will build an Advanced Quiz Application that tests the user's knowledge across various topics. The quiz will be interactive, timed, and feature multiple-choice questions. You will use functions to organize the code into logical sections, demonstrating modular programming.

Task Requirements
Basic Functionality
    1. Question Bank:
        ◦ Create a categorized question bank (e.g., easy, medium, hard).
        ◦ Each question should include:
            ▪ A question string.
            ▪ Four multiple-choice options.
            ▪ The correct answer.
    2. Quiz Flow:
        ◦ Allow the user to select a difficulty level: easy, medium, or hard.
        ◦ Randomly pick a set number of questions from the chosen category.
    3. User Input:
        ◦ Prompt the user to select answers for each question.
        ◦ Provide feedback on whether the answer was correct or incorrect.
    4. Score Calculation:
        ◦ Track the number of correct answers.
        ◦ Display the final score at the end of the quiz.
    5. Replay Option:
        ◦ Allow users to play the quiz multiple times.

Advanced Features
    1. Randomized Questions:
        ◦ Shuffle the questions each time the quiz is played.
    2. Multiple Choice:
        ◦ Implement multiple-choice answers for each question.
    3. Timed Responses:
        ◦ Add a time limit (e.g., 10 seconds) to answer each question.
    4. Difficulty Levels:
        ◦ Include separate categories for easy, medium, and hard questions.
    5. Leaderboard:
        ◦ Track and display the top scores across all quiz attempts.
    6. Dynamic Feedback:
        ◦ Display whether the user's answer was correct and the correct answer for incorrect responses.
    7. User-Friendly Design:
        ◦ Provide clear instructions and intuitive input prompts.

Example User Story
    1. The user starts the quiz and enters their name.
    2. The program asks the user to choose a difficulty level (e.g., easy).
    3. The program presents randomized multiple-choice questions from the "easy" category.
    4. The user answers each question within a time limit. The program provides feedback after each question.
    5. At the end of the quiz, the program displays the user's score and updates the leaderboard.
    6. The user can view the leaderboard and decide to play again or exit the game.

Skills Practiced
    • Functions: Creating modular, reusable code.
    • Parameters and Return Values: Passing data between functions and processing results.
    • Randomization: Using Python’s random module to shuffle questions.
    • Conditional Logic: Handling user input and determining quiz outcomes.
    • Timers: Using the time module to enforce time limits.
    • Data Structures: Working with lists and tuples to manage questions and scores.
